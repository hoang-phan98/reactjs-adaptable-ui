# A React Toolkit for building Adaptable User Interfaces

- This project aims to provide developers with an easy-to-use toolkit for incorporating adaptivity into web development.
- We have created a set of adaptable UI components, built on top of the React.JS framework and MaterialUI Library.
- These components provide integrated accessibility features for challenged users with different needs.
- We then used these components to rebuild the front page UI of the Centrelink website as a POC.

## Getting started
Please use the demo video in the root directory as a starting point for familiarising yourself with our framework.
